									<h2 class="major">Workshop Topics</h2>
									<p>The recent development of the Internet of Things (IoT) brings forward numerous novel technologies whose application scenarios are not only applied to the user level (e.g., individual consumer or private company), but also the system level (e.g., commercial or industrial sector). For example, the IoT plays a significant role in the current Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) which consists of advanced sensing, wireless communications, cloud computing, intelligent control, massive data management, and many other elements. By leveraging the IoT, different entities (e.g., vehicles, drivers, riders, infrastructure, traffic management centers, etc.) in the existing transportation system get connected with each other, thus making the entire system smarter, safer, and more efficient.</p>

									<p>However, these advances also bring significant challenges to public authorities, industry, as well as scientific communities. In terms of system design and control, current IoT applications in ITS need to be refined or even redesigned to better function under uncertainties in demand, and to better cooperate with existing conventional vehicles and infrastructure. From the performance assessment perspective, models and simulation tools based on artificial intelligence and big data have been widely developed for validation and evaluation of IoT applications, in particular taking into account the increasing trends in vehicle connectivity and automation. However, the validity of these models needs to be re-examined with field implementations.</p>

									<p>This workshop will be the second of its series (the first one was held in IEEE IV 2020), focusing on sharing the state-of-the-art design, models, algorithms, simulation, and field implementation of a wide range of IoT applications in ITS, identifing challenges as well as research needs, and aiming to encourage cross-disciplinary cooperation. The specific topics of interests are listed below:</p>

									•	Digital twin of intelligent vehicles and intelligent transportation systems</br>
									•	Vehicular cyber-physical systems (VCPS) </br>
									•	IoT applications in smart cities </br>
									•	Cyber security of connected and automated vehicles </br>
									•	Vehicle-to-cloud (V2C) communications </br>
									•	Artificial intelligence and big data application in urban mobility </br>
									•	Edge computing and cloud computing of connected vehicles </br>
									•	Modelling and simulation tools for network computing and communication </br>
									•	Field implementations of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) </br>
									•	Applications of emerging communication technologies (e.g., 5G, Wi-Fi 6) to ITS </br>
									•	Message or standard definitions to support V2X communicaitons </br>

										Traffic Optimization for Signalized Corridors  (TOSCo) Development and Evaluation with VISSIM</strong><br><br>
										The Traffic Optimization for Signalized Corridors (TOSCo) system is a vehicle-to-infrastructure connected vehicle 
										application that uses level one autonomy to adjust a vehicle’s speed on the approach of a signalized intersection.  
										The system uses information from the infrastructure’s DSRC broadcasts to plan a speed trajectory that allows it to 
										either pass through the intersection without stopping or stop in a smooth, coordinated fashion to reduce the amount 
										of time stopped at the intersection.  This presentation will explain the simulation setup for developing and testing 
										the TOSCo vehicle algorithm as well as the simulations for evaluating TOSCo performance for a corridor.</p><br><br>

										LGSVL Simulator: A High Fidelity Simulator for Autonomous Driving</strong><br><br>
										Testing autonomous driving algorithms on real autonomous vehicles is extremely costly and many researchers 
										and developers in the field cannot afford a real car and the corresponding sensors. 
										Although several free and open-source autonomous driving stacks, such as Autoware and Apollo are available, 
										choices of open-source simulators to use with them are limited. In this paper, 
										we introduce the LGSVL Simulator which is a high fidelity simulator for autonomous driving. 
										The simulator engine provides end-to-end, full-stack simulation which is ready to be hooked up to Autoware and Apollo. 
										In addition, simulator tools are provided with the core simulation engine which allow users to easily customize sensors, 
										create new types of controllable objects, replace some modules in the core simulator, and create digital twins of particular environments.</p><br><br>

										Connected and Automated Vehicles: Major Shifts in Vehicle R&D Methods</strong><br><br>
										Rapid advancement in vehicle computing technology, connectivity, controls, and autonomous operation of advanced
										vehicles has increased the difficulty of testing and modeling systems that control vehicles and traffic. Much 
										of the challenge stems from the complexity of the new system-of-systems approach required to manage connected 
										and autonomous vehicles and vehicles equipped with advanced driver-assistance systems as they interact with other 
										vehicles, surrounding environments, and larger traffic networks. This talk will discuss some of the simulation 
										and hardware-in-the-loop approaches ORNL and partners are using to develop and combine new and old methods to 
										conduct research across these areas.</p><br><br>

										Modeling and Evaluation of Autonomous Vehicles in Mixed Traffic using an Integrated SUMO-Unity Platform</strong><br><br>
										With the increasing penetration rate of autonomous vehicles, the research need related to mixed traffic is increasing. 
										To provide an easier way to test autonomous algorithms in a mixed traffic scenario, 
										we develop an integrated SUMO-Unity platform. The platform creates user-controlled 
										and NPC vehicles in Unity based on the traffic flow generated from SUMO.
										The traffic flow recreated in Unity can react to the user-controlled 
										vehicles based on the basic car-following model and lane-change model. 
										The user-controlled vehicles therefore can be put into a virtual transportation network by applying real-time traffic simulation.</p><br><br>

										Learning Adaptable Policy via Meta-Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Decision-making Tasks</strong><br><br>										
										Learning from demonstrations has gained popularity in learning policies directly from expert behaviors 
										for decision-making and control tasks. Some state-of-the-art methods include Imitation Learning (IL), 
										Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL), Adversarial 
										Inverse Reinforcement Learning (AIRL). It does not require a reward function that is hard to be manually 
										designed especially for complex tasks, but it generally needs abundant of demonstrations to gain the 
										ability of mimicking expert behaviors. Furthermore, the learned behavior usually works only in that 
										specific task environment and fails to generalize to new tasks with different distributions. In reality, 
										it is usually the case that we continuously enrich the data set by collecting new data from new tasks or 
										environments. For example, to learn an automated lane-change behavior, we may train our vehicle agent with 
										thousands or even millions of labeled driving demonstrations from different cities or countries, but these 
										demonstrations may not cover all the possible situations and we may still have new data obtained from other 
										cities or countries that are not originally included in our training data set. In this situation, it is labor 
										intensive and cost expensive to keep labeling all the newly acquired data and retrain the model from scratch again. 
										Therefore, it is essential to have a model that can make good use of the knowledge learned from existing tasks and 
										generalize quickly to new tasks with limited or even unlabeled data samples. Meta-learning is an approach to adapt 
										learned models to novel settings by exploiting the inherent35learning similarities across a distribution of tasks. 
										In this work, we combine Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning and Meta-learning to learn the model initialization 
										that can be quickly fine-tuned and adapted to new situations with limited data. We then apply the proposed method to 
										complex decision-making tasks in autonomous vehicles.</p><br><br>

										Anomaly Behavior Management: Reducing the Impact of Anomalous Drivers with Connected Vehicles</strong><br><br>
										Passenger vehicles operated by anomalous drivers, who are distracted on roads and perform errorable driving behaviors, 
										result in increased risk of collisions to themselves and their surrounding vehicles. Eliminating the impact of anomalous 
										drivers to the surrounding vehicles is very critical to improve driving safety. In this study, an anomaly management system 
										is developed with the help of connected vehicles to solve the problem. An errorable car-following model is applied to model 
										the dynamics of anomalous vehicles and to analyze their impacts to other vehicles. The system utilizes connected vehicles to 
										monitor the errorable behaviors of the anomaly drivers and estimates acceleration and lane changing advice for connected vehicles 
										to avoid dangerous behaviors. In addition, a hierarchical architecture is integrated with the proposed system to reduce the risk 
										of collision caused by anomaly vehicles in large-scale road networks. A microscopic traffic simulation is applied to evaluate the 
										benefits of the proposed system on reducing the risk of collisions and improving mobility for both connected vehicles and whole 
										networks. In addition, a sensitivity analysis of market penetration rates of connected vehicles and traffic demand levels will be 
										conducted to understand the reliability of the system at different development stages of connected vehicles and traffic congestion.</p><br><br>

										Modeling the Impacts of Future Mobility Technologies using the POLARIS SMART Mobility Workflow</strong><br><br>
										Recent advances in vehicle technologies, mobility services and transportation system management have the potential to fundamentally change 
										the way transportation is provided and used in the near future. Technologies such as connectivity, both between vehicles and with infrastructure,
										and automation have the ability to allow vehicles to travel more efficiently, safely and economically, and enable new forms of mobility to emerge. 
										However, recent studies have also shown that there is the potential for these new technologies to drastically alter the way individuals travel 
										leading to increases in congestions, energy use, emissions and so on, in some scenarios. Different vehicle and transportation technologies 
										interact in complex ways with the transportation system as a whole and with individual travel behavior. In order to understand these complex 
										interactions and evaluate the potential benefits of future mobility technologies, the SMART Mobility modeling workflow was recently developed.  
										This workflow seeks to evaluate new transportation technologies such as connectivity, automation, sharing, and electrification using multi-level 
										simulation analysis that captures interactions between technologies and travelers. The workflow is centered around the POLARIS agent-based 
										activity-travel demand simulation tool, and integrates through multiple other models at different levels of scale and resolution (i.e. individual 
										vehicle simulations, connected vehicle simulations in traffic microsimulation, long-term land use simulation) to gain insights about the influence
										of new mobility and vehicle technologies at the system level.</p><br><br> -->
