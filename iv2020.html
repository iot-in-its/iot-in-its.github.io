									<h2 class="major">Workshop Topics</h2>
									<p>The recent development of the Internet of Things (IoT) brings forward numerous novel technologies whose application scenarios are not only limited to the user level (e.g., individual consumer or private company), but can also be applied to the system level (e.g., commercial or industrial sector). For example, the IoT plays a significant role in the current Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), which is a system consists of vehicular communications, cloud computing, intelligent control, massive data management, and many other elements. By leveraging the IoT, different entities (e.g., vehicles, drivers, riders, infrastructures, traffic management centers, etc) in the existing transportation system get connected with each other, thus making the entire system smarter.</p>

									<p>A rising and ubiquitous trend in this IoT context is represented by “digital twin”, where a real-time update of big data from the physical world’s entities is required to update the corresponding digital replicas in the cyber world. As an extension concept to digital twin, “parallel driving” also considers the mental world besides the physical world and the cyber world, which models the cognitive behaviors of human drivers, with the ability of enabling learning and interaction between the physical and cyber drivers. Both the computing architecture and the communication networks/protocols within the framework of digital twin or parallel driving are built to achieve higher efficiency, fidelity, and reliability.</p>

									<p>However, along these developments come a few challenges for authorities, industry, as well as scientific communities. In terms of system design and control, current IoT applications in ITS need to be refined or even redesigned to better function under uncertainties in demand, and to better cooperate with existing conventional vehicles and infrastructures. From the performance assessment perspective, models and simulation tools based on artificial intelligence and big data have been widely developed to verify the performance of IoT applications, in particular taking into account the increasing trends in vehicle connectivity and automation. However, the validity of these models needs to be re-examined with field implementations.</p>

									<p>This workshop focuses on sharing the state-of-the-art design, models, algorithms, simulation, and field implementation of a wide range of IoT applications in ITS (such as digital twin and parallel driving), and identifies challenges as well as research needs, aiming to encourage cross-disciplinary cooperation.</p>

										Sensor Fusion of Camera and Cloud Digital Twin Information for Intelligent Vehicles</strong><br><br>
										With the rapid development of intelligent vehicles
										and Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS), a mixed
										level of human driver engagements is involved in the
										transportation system. Visual guidance for drivers is essential
										under this situation to prevent potential risks. To advance the
										development of visual guidance systems, we introduce a novel
										sensor fusion methodology, integrating camera image and
										Digital Twin knowledge from the cloud. Target vehicle bounding
										box is drawn and matched by combining results of object
										detector running on ego vehicle and position information from
										the cloud. The best matching result, with a 79.2% accuracy
										under 0.7 Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold, is obtained
										with depth image served as an additional feature source. Game
										engine-based simulation results also reveal that the visual
										guidance system could improve driving safety significantly
										cooperate with the cloud Digital Twin system.</p><br><br>

										Digital Twins: From Macro to Micro</strong><br><br>
										Simulation is now an integral part of automated vehicle testing programs, and many more miles are simulated than are 
										driven on the road. High fidelity digital twins are required for accurate simulations, and rely in turn on large amounts 
										of data collected from the real world, in the form of HD maps and sensor data. While simulation-based AV testing has been 
										used to massive effect for testing edge cases and large numbers of miles, it will be necessary for future simulations to 
										be even more realistic. They will have to enable AV simulations in different seasons of the year and under different 
										weather conditions (beyond current capabilities). They will have to include increasingly rural environments where lane 
										markings and surface conditions are poor. This will motivate the use of high-fidelity vehicle dynamics models that offer 
										realistic performance in extreme operating regimes. Sensor models and their validation will need to become more specific, 
										narrowing in on different brands and specifications. We summarize three studies at the National Advanced Driving Simulator, 
										both simulation and on-road. Based on this research, we discuss the benefits of a high-fidelity digital twin and its 
										application to the three study areas. While we begin with the more-common macro applications that involve many miles 
										and/or many vehicles, we end with the micro. There is much benefit to be gained from studying the interactions of one 
										driver with one vehicle, or between one AV and a vulnerable road user, in a realistic simulation environment</p><br><br>

										Design and Field Implementation of IoT Systems with Real-Time Traffic Video Analytics</strong><br><br>
										Video analytics is driving a wide range of smart mobility applications with great potential to benefit transportation and infrastructure systems. 
										Most applications, e.g., traffic surveillance and autonomous driving, require not only high intelligence but also real-time operation. 
										However, real-time video analytics is considered the “killer app” for the Internet of Things (IoT) and often bottlenecked by the large 
										amounts of video data, high computational cost, and limited network bandwidth. In this talk, I will introduce the challenges and advances 
										in real-time traffic video analytics and their applications in transportation IoT. Specifically, I will talk about our recent work on the 
										design and field implementation of such IoT systems for smart infrastructure and automated vehicle testing. </p><br><br>

										Integrating Autonomy into Traffic Systems: Scalable Control and Optimization</strong><br><br>
										Traffic systems are undergoing a fundamental transformation. The emergence of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) 
										provides tremendous opportunities for sustainability, efficiency, and safety. Before 100% CAVs are introduced in traffic 
										systems, there will be a long transition period of mixed mobility, where both human-driven vehicles and CAVs co-exist. 
										Timely and important questions are: can a small number of CAVs benefit urban mobility, and, if so, how? Moreover, the 
										design and operation of CAVs in traffic systems are becoming increasingly complex, due to system size, connectivity, 
										and heterogeneity. This talk presents contributions in distributed control and scalable optimization techniques, which 
										are critical for integrating autonomous vehicles into the existing traffic systems. In particular, I will provide 
										theoretical evidence of the high potential of CAVs in mixed mobility, and I will further show how to exploit sparsity 
										structures to design scalable and distributed algorithms that allow operating CAVs in large-scale mixed traffic systems.</p><br><br>

										IoT and Smart Connected Vehicles Enabling MaaS Opportunities</strong><br><br>
										The transportation industry currently is undergoing a huge transformation – estimated by some to be the biggest 
										transformation in its history – driven by Mobility as a Service (MaaS) opportunities and IoT revolution. 
										Vehicles increasingly are being equipped with embedded connectivity. By 2025, the Automotive Edge Computing 
										Consortium predicts that the connected car market will be worth $150 Billion, with 100 million connected 
										vehicles on the road. Analysts indicate that connected car capabilities already influence 6 out of 10 vehicle 
										purchases, giving vehicle manufacturers the ability to open new revenue streams, diversify core activities, 
										and improve profit margins by selling software and connected services. Smart vehicles are increasing becoming 
										most important verticals in IoT platform and processing the data from connected vehicles is one of the big 
										challenges all automakers are currently facing. But these challenges also provide opportunities to build hyper 
										connected cyber-physical systems (also called Digital Twin) with several interesting use cases like personalized 
										intelligent driving and smart traffic management.</p><br><br>

										Traffic Flow Smoothing at Scale</strong><br><br>
										This talk will discuss modeling, simulation, and field demonstration advancements that are needed to control automated 
										vehicles to stabilize traffic flow at scale. Prior work on a closed course established that automated vehicles can 
										eliminate human-generated phantom traffic jams that seemingly occur without cause, reducing fuel consumption by up 
										to 40%. The talk will describe the research challenges and progress towards demonstrating traffic flow smoothing with 
										a fleet of connected and autonomous vehicles on the I-24 Smart Corridor in Tennessee, as part of the CIRCLES Consortium.</p><br><br>

										Field Implementation of IoV Application for Improving Energy Efficiency of Heavy-Duty Vehicles</strong><br><br>
										In recent years, the emergence of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technology has inspired numerous applications targeted 
										at improving existing transportation systems. As one of the widely studied applications of IoV technology, connected 
										eco-driving utilizes Signal Phase and Timing (SPaT) information from the upcoming traffic signal to design speed profile 
										for the connected vehicle to pass through the signalized intersection in an energy-efficient manner. To date, the majority 
										of connected eco-driving studies have been conducted through numerical or traffic simulations. Few studies have implemented
										the application on real vehicles, and even fewer have been focused on heavy-duty trucks. In this presentation, the field 
										implementation of a connected eco-driving system for heavy-duty trucks that is enabled by cellular communications will be 
										described. Results and lessons learned from field trials of the system along two major freight corridors in the City of Carson, 
										California, will also be discussed.</p><br><br>

										CTwin – The Chattanooga Mobility Digital Twin – Heralding the Next Generation in Observability and Control</strong><br><br>
										Congestion continues to be a significant contributor to energy inefficiency in the US. In 2017, highway congestion 
										wasted over 3.3 billion gallons of fuel and caused 8.8 billion hours of lost productivity. Trucks accounted for $20 
										billion (11%) of the cost representing 7% of traffic. The talk focuses on the development of the City of Chattanooga’s 
										Digital Twin, named CTwin, that has delivered a regional-scale, open, scalable, real-time situational awareness platform 
										that brings in 500+ primary data streams from 7 proprietary vendor systems across 3 institutions, in addition to 40+ 
										distinct data layers to create a capability that is unique for the Vehicle Technologies Office. Metrics based on industry 
										standards (MAP-21, Automated Traffic Signal Performance Measures - ATSPM) have been formulated to compute energy usage 
										estimates, regional speed, volume, and fuel used, as well as derive travel time reliability and percent stops on red, 
										besides others. Advanced data science approaches on real-time feeds have produced novel and exceptionally well received 
										data visualizations. Further, data-driven discoveries have led to an implementation of a control approach that is starting 
										to yield significant energy savings for the city. Talk will focus on the research, the developed capabilities, and the 
										anticipated outcomes of this work.</p><br><br>
